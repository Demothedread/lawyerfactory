- [ ] Build cause of action template library for common legal claims
- [ ] Add legal element completion tracking and validation

### 7. Enhance ResearchBot for Automated Legal Rule Discovery
- [ ] Extend `research_bot.py` to search legal standards by cause of action and jurisdiction
- [ ] Add judicial test extraction from CourtListener case law results
- [ ] Implement rule confidence scoring and relevance ranking
- [ ] Create human review queue for suggested legal standards
- [ ] Build legal standard template matching for common tests (reasonable person, substantial factor, etc.)

### 8. Build Comprehensive Bluebook Citation System
- [ ] Create citation formatting module for cases, statutes, regulations, and secondary sources
- [ ] Integrate automatic citation generation from ResearchBot results
- [ ] Add manual citation editing interface with validation
- [ ] Implement citation cross-referencing and duplicate detection
- [ ] Build citation export functionality for bibliography generation

## Phase 4: Skeletal Outline Generation and Workflow Integration

### 9. Create Intelligent Outline Generator
- [ ] Build complaint template system with customizable sections (Introduction, Facts, Claims, Relief)
- [ ] Implement fact-to-claim mapping for automatic section population
- [ ] Add legal precedent integration for argument structure suggestions
- [ ] Create outline preview with expandable sections and fact references
- [ ] Build outline export functionality with proper legal formatting

### 10. Integrate with Enhanced Maestro Workflow System
- [ ] Add evidence table completion triggers for Phase 2 outline generation
- [ ] Create human approval checkpoints between evidence processing and outline creation
- [ ] Implement workflow state persistence for evidence, facts, and claims data
- [ ] Add progress tracking for evidence table completion percentage
- [ ] Build structured data handoff to drafting phase with organized fact patterns

## Phase 5: Advanced Features and Polish

### 11. Implement Advanced Search and Analytics
- [ ] Build semantic search across evidence content using vector embeddings
- [ ] Add evidence gap analysis to identify missing supporting documentation
- [ ] Create claims strength analytics with visual dashboards
- [ ] Implement evidence usage tracking across multiple cases
- [ ] Add AI-powered evidence relevance suggestions

### 12. Add Collaboration and Review Features
- [ ] Build evidence review and approval workflow for multi-attorney teams
- [ ] Add comment and annotation system for evidence entries
- [ ] Implement version control for facts and claims modifications
- [ ] Create audit trail for all evidence table changes
- [ ] Add privilege review markers and redaction capabilities

### 13. Integration Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for evidence table functionality
- [ ] Test integration with existing workflow phases (Intake, Research, Drafting)
- [ ] Write user documentation for evidence table workflows
- [ ] Create training materials for legal teams
- [ ] Perform load testing with large evidence sets (1000+ entries)

## Success Metrics
