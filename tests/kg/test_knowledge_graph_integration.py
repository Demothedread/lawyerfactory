                This is a complex motor vehicle accident case involving multiple parties and 
                extensive factual disputes. On January 15, 2024, at approximately 2:30 PM, 
                plaintiff John Doe was driving his 2020 Honda Civic southbound on Main Street 
                approaching the intersection with First Street. At the same time, defendant 
                MegaCorp Inc.'s delivery truck, operated by employee driver Jane Smith, was 
                traveling eastbound on First Street. 
                
                According to witness testimony from pedestrian Bob Johnson, the MegaCorp truck 
                was traveling at an excessive speed estimated at 45 mph in a 25 mph zone. 
                The traffic light at the intersection was red for eastbound traffic on First Street.
                Despite the red light, defendant's driver failed to stop and proceeded through 
                the intersection, colliding with plaintiff's vehicle.
                
                The collision occurred in the middle of the intersection, with the defendant's 
                truck striking the plaintiff's vehicle on the driver's side door. The impact 
                caused plaintiff's vehicle to spin approximately 180 degrees before coming to 
                rest against a concrete barrier.
                
                As a direct and proximate result of the collision, plaintiff sustained multiple 
                serious injuries including: a compound fracture of the left femur, traumatic 
                brain injury resulting in a concussion, three broken ribs, and extensive 
                lacerations requiring surgical repair. Plaintiff was transported by ambulance 
                to City General Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery.
                
                Medical records indicate that plaintiff's medical expenses to date exceed $75,000, 
                and plaintiff has been unable to work for six months, resulting in lost wages 
                of approximately $45,000. Plaintiff continues to experience pain and suffering 
                and will require additional medical treatment and physical therapy.
                
                Investigation by the police revealed that defendant's driver had been working 
                for 12 consecutive hours prior to the accident, in violation of federal hours 
                of service regulations. Additionally, the defendant's vehicle maintenance records 
                show that the brakes had not been properly serviced in over 18 months.
