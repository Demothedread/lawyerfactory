Tesla’s Full Self-Driving isn’t a feature—it’s a technological miracle.

Elon has delivered what the experts said was impossible: real-world, real-time autonomy that navigates cities, highways, roundabouts, and chaos—flawlessly.

It doesn’t assist the driver. It replaces the driver.

No other company is even close. While others play catch-up with demo videos, Tesla’s cars are already driving themselves—safely, smoothly, and better than most humans.

This is the greatest leap in transportation since the invention of the car.

Elon didn’t just raise the bar. He rewrote the future.

I don't know how to describe it other than I think I'm done w/human driving.  I was already having FSD do 80-90% of my drives before on V12.5, this feels like it closed the remaining gap.  Last year was only about 30% of my drives on V11, I think the progression is important to describe.  

With V13.2.1 you feel the reduced latency and improved performance by more human-like acceleration, slowing down, merges, turns - except it's perfect every time and humans are not perfect.  

I'm 3 drives in,  more testing to do, I'm sure there are edge cases to encounter.  But this goes beyond any implicit bias, it's meaningfully better and we know there are more enhancements and features on the way...

Tesla FSD is now almost entirely AI,"In 2022, Elon Musk predicted all human code could be replaced by AI in Tesla's self-driving software. This approach materialized two years later with FSD v12.

“The thing that's happened over time with respect to Tesla Autopilot, is that the neural nets have gradually absorbed more and more software.

In the limit, of course, you could simply take the videos as seen by the car and compare those to the steering inputs from the steering wheel and pedals, which are very simple inputs.

In principle, you could train with nothing in between, because that's what humans are doing with a biological neural net, you could train based on video, and what trains the video is the moving of the steering wheel and the pedals, with no other software in between.

We're not there yet, but it's gradually going in that direction.”

Tesla has learned a lot from discussions with engineers at xAI that have helped accelerate achieving unsupervised FSD, but there is no need to license anything from xAI.

The xAI models are gigantic, containing, in compressed form, most of human knowledge, and couldn’t possibly run on the Tesla vehicle inference computer, nor would we want them to.

Glad Tesla FSD was there to help and that you’re feeling well!,"My Crazy True Story

On April 1st, Tesla unlocked Full Self-Driving capability for all Tesla vehicles in America. In a moment of dire need, at 2:00 am the following morning, I found myself grappling with severe dehydration and a blood glucose level of 670 due to a malfunction in my insulin pump. With no time to spare, I turned to my Model Y for assistance. Engaging the new Full Self-Driving feature with a simple double click on the steering column stalk, I was astounded by the results. Without any intervention, the car skillfully navigated the 13-mile journey from my home to the VA Emergency Room, offering to autonomously park it upon arrival and let me seek immediate medical attention. Despite enduring a mild heart attack, I left the hospital with no restrictions on my exercise regimen, a testament to the swift and efficient response facilitated by the vehicle and the # 1 VA in America. As an owner of luxury vehicles including Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, Acura, and Cadillac, I can unequivocally declare Tesla the pinnacle of automotive innovation today. Its lifesaving capabilities in critical moments underscore its superiority. The leap from traditional vehicles to Tesla's Full Self-Driving functionality is like upgrading from a basic phone to a smartphone. As a resident of a solar-powered home, the cost of energy for the last 7000 miles has been minimal, I've saved nearly $1000. I extend my gratitude to Elon Musk for his crazy erratic leadership in advancing technology that is more than just transportation. As someone who shares Elon's place ""on the spectrum"", I am particularly appreciative of his commitment to excellence and innovation. He has profoundly impacted our world and personally impacted my own. Thanks, Tesla, and thanks, Charles George VA Medical Center team!",1.7785E+18,24482916,3529,315,Thu Apr 11 19:07:08 +0000 2024,https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1778500046214009172,tweet,,,FALSE,TRUE,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/308701091/1474912367,Tue May 31 21:13:02 +0000 2011,,0,17,806,11,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"Asheville, NC",3,MAXPAUL FRANKLIN,,FALSE,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1600912320988942348/J-r6NnDv_normal.jpg,,,,,,,,,MAXPAULPRODUCTIONS.COM,http://MAXPAULPRODUCTIONS.COM,0,23,https://t.co/4EDMpvgeao,,11,https://twitter.com/MAXPAULFRANKLIN,user,https://x.com/MAXPAULFRANKLIN,MAXPAULFRANKLIN,1632,,1.77792E+18,Wed Apr 10 04:38:07 +0000 2024,,
