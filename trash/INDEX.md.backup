# Trash Index - Files Moved for Review

## Streamlining Refactor - August 21, 2025

This directory contains files that have been moved from the main codebase during the streamlining refactor. These files are preserved for human review before final deletion.

## Files Moved to Trash

### Deprecated Shim Files (`trash/deprecated_shims/`)
The following files were deprecated shims that will be removed in the next release. They only contained deprecation warnings and import redirects:

- `lawyerfactory/agent_config_system.py` → Redirects to `lawyerfactory.lf_core.agent_config`
- `lawyerfactory/document_type_framework.py` → Redirects to `lawyerfactory.lf_core.document_types`
- `lawyerfactory/enhanced_workflow.py` → Redirects to `lawyerfactory.compose.maestro.workflow`
- `lawyerfactory/file-storage.py` → Redirects to `lawyerfactory.infra.file_storage`
- `lawyerfactory/knowledge_graph.py` → Redirects to `lawyerfactory.kg.graph`
- `lawyerfactory/mcp_memory_integration.py` → Redirects to `lawyerfactory.vectors.memory_compression`
- `lawyerfactory/models.py` → Redirects to `lawyerfactory.lf_core.models`
- `lawyerfactory/workflow.py` → Redirects to `lawyerfactory.compose.maestro.workflow`

### System Files (`trash/system_files/`)
- `lawyerfactory/.DS_Store` - macOS system file
- `lawyerfactory/__pycache__/` - Python bytecode cache directory

## Rationale for Removal

1. **Deprecated Shims**: These files were explicitly marked as "AUTO-GENERATED SHIM: will be removed in next release" and only served as temporary redirects during a migration period.

2. **System Files**: .DS_Store files and __pycache__ directories are generated automatically and should not be tracked in version control.

## Next Steps

1. Review the moved files to ensure no functionality is lost
2. Test the application to confirm everything still works
3. If satisfied, these files can be permanently deleted
4. If issues are found, use the undo script to restore files

## Undo Script

An undo script is available at `trash/undo_script.sh` to restore all moved files to their original locations.
