# lawyerfactory

This repository contains an experimental agent-based workflow for generating long-form legal content. The approach relies on a team of specialized GPT-4.1-mini agents managed in an assembly-line fashion.

See [docs/team_chart.md](docs/team_chart.md) for an overview of the agents and phases.

The knowledge graph describing entities and relationships is stored in `knowledge_graph.json` and can be updated via `knowledge_graph.py`.
