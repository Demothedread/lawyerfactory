# 📁 Documentation Archive

This directory contains archived README files that have been consolidated into the main [README.md](../../README.md) and [SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md](../../SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Archived Files

### 📄 README_OLD.md

Previous version of the main README before consolidation.

### 📄 README_MULTISWARM.md

Specialized documentation for the MultiSWARM system architecture. Content has been integrated into the main README under the "Agent Swarm Architecture" section.

**Key content moved to:**

- Main README: Agent Swarm Architecture section
- SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md: Multi-Agent Architecture section

### 📄 README_PAN_Analyzer.md

Documentation for the PAN Skynet Analyzer security rule analysis tool. This appears to be a separate project and may need its own repository.

**Note:** This appears to be unrelated to LawyerFactory core functionality and may belong in a separate repository.

### 📄 STATEMENT_OF_FACTS_GENERATOR_README.md

Comprehensive documentation for the Statement of Facts Generation Engine. Content has been integrated into the main documentation.

**Key content moved to:**

- Main README: Advanced Features section
- SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md: Specialized Document Generation Engines section

## Documentation Consolidation Strategy

All README files have been consolidated following these principles:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: One comprehensive README.md at project root
2. **Searchable Structure**: Clear table of contents with keyword search capability
3. **Logical Organization**: Content grouped by user journey (Getting Started → Usage → Development → Troubleshooting)
4. **Technical Depth**: Detailed technical information moved to SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md
5. **Cross-References**: Clear links between related sections

## Accessing Consolidated Documentation

**For Users:**

- Start with [README.md](../../README.md) for installation and basic usage
- Check [USER_GUIDE.md](../../USER_GUIDE.md) for comprehensive troubleshooting

**For Developers:**

- See [SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md](../../SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md) for technical details
- Review [docs/](../) directory for specific component documentation

**For Contributors:**

- Follow contribution guidelines in main README.md
- Check development workflow documentation

## Migration Notes

- All functional content has been preserved and integrated
- Links have been updated to point to consolidated locations
- Search keywords have been added for easy navigation
- Redundant information has been deduplicated
- Project-specific content (like PAN Analyzer) flagged for potential separation
