# Legal Specialist Instructions for LLM Fine-Tuning

## Overview
These instructions are designed to fine-tune the LLM's legal reasoning capabilities, ensuring rigorous adherence to legal standards, proper case law analysis, and sound legal logic. The instructions focus on the critical validation points that must be checked before any legal document progresses to final generation.

## Core Validation Framework

### 1. Legal Logic Soundness
**Objective**: Ensure all legal arguments are logically sound and coherent.

**Required Checks**:
- **Syllogistic Structure**: Every argument must follow proper logical structure (major premise → minor premise → conclusion)
- **No Contradictions**: Arguments within and across claims must not contradict each other
- **Supported Premises**: All premises must be supported by either facts or legal authority
- **Valid Conclusions**: Conclusions must logically follow from the premises

**Example**:
```
MAJOR PREMISE: Under California law, a duty of care is owed by manufacturers to consumers.
MINOR PREMISE: Defendant is a manufacturer and plaintiff is a consumer.
CONCLUSION: Defendant owed plaintiff a duty of care.
```

### 2. Case Precedent Accuracy
**Objective**: Ensure cited cases actually support the propositions for which they are cited.

**Required Checks**:
- **Holding Alignment**: The case holding must directly support the cited proposition
- **Factual Similarity**: Case facts must be sufficiently similar to current case
- **Jurisdictional Validity**: Case must come from appropriate jurisdiction or persuasive authority
- **Subsequent Modification**: Check if case has been overruled, limited, or distinguished

**Validation Questions**:
- Does the case actually hold what we claim it holds?
- Are the facts analogous to our case?
- Is the case binding or merely persuasive?
- Has the case been subsequently modified?

### 3. Rule of Law Completeness
**Objective**: Ensure legal rules are completely and accurately stated.

**Required Elements**:
- **Complete Statement**: Rule must include all elements and requirements
- **Exceptions Listed**: All exceptions and limitations must be included
- **Jurisdictional Limits**: Any jurisdictional limitations must be specified
- **Recent Modifications**: Check for recent changes to the rule

**Example for Negligence Rule**:
```
COMPLETE RULE: One who undertakes to render services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of a third person is subject to liability to the third person for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to protect his undertaking, if (a) his failure to exercise reasonable care increases the risk of such harm, or (b) he has undertaken to perform a duty owed by the other to the third person, or (c) the harm is suffered because of reliance of the other or the third person upon the undertaking.
```

### 4. Legal Test/Standard Invocation
**Objective**: Ensure correct legal tests and standards are invoked and applied.

**Required Checks**:
- **Correct Test Selection**: Must use the proper test for the legal issue
- **Proper Burden of Proof**: Must apply correct burden (preponderance, clear and convincing, beyond reasonable doubt)
- **Element-by-Element Analysis**: Each element of the test must be addressed
- **Balancing Test Application**: For multi-factor tests, all factors must be considered

**Common Legal Tests**:
- **Negligence**: Duty → Breach → Causation → Damages
- **Contract Formation**: Offer → Acceptance → Consideration
- **Summary Judgment**: No genuine issue of material fact
- **Rule 12(b)(6)**: Failure to state claim upon which relief can be granted

### 5. Jurisdictional Applicability
**Objective**: Ensure proper jurisdictional analysis and application.

**Required Analysis**:
- **Subject Matter Jurisdiction**: Court has authority to hear the type of case
- **Personal Jurisdiction**: Defendant has sufficient contacts with forum
- **Venue**: Proper geographic location for the case
- **Removal Considerations**: Whether case can/should be removed to federal court

**Federal Court Analysis**:
- **Federal Question**: Case arises under federal law
- **Diversity Jurisdiction**: Complete diversity + amount in controversy ≥ $75,000
- **Supplemental Jurisdiction**: Related claims with common nucleus of fact

### 6. Analytical Accuracy
**Objective**: Ensure legal analysis is thorough, accurate, and complete.

**Required Elements**:
- **Issue Identification**: Clear statement of the legal question
- **Rule Statement**: Complete and accurate statement of applicable law
- **Application**: Specific application of facts to each element of the rule
- **Counterarguments**: Anticipation and addressing of opposing arguments
- **Conclusion**: Clear resolution of the issue

## LLM Fine-Tuning Instructions

### Chain of Thought Process
1. **Identify the Legal Issue**: What specific legal question needs to be answered?
2. **Research the Applicable Law**: What statutes, cases, or rules apply?
3. **Analyze the Facts**: How do the specific facts relate to the legal elements?
4. **Apply the Law to Facts**: Does each element of the rule/test apply?
5. **Consider Counterarguments**: What arguments might the other side make?
6. **Draw Conclusion**: What is the legally correct outcome?

### Validation Checkpoints
- [ ] Legal logic is sound and coherent
- [ ] Case precedent accurately supports proposition
- [ ] Rule of law is completely stated
- [ ] Correct legal test/standard invoked
- [ ] Jurisdictional requirements satisfied
- [ ] Analysis is thorough and accurate
- [ ] IRAC structure properly followed
- [ ] Citations are complete and accurate
- [ ] Counterarguments addressed
- [ ] Conclusion logically follows from analysis

### Error Prevention
- Avoid conclusory statements without factual support
- Do not cherry-pick facts or authority

## Implementation in Orchestration Phase

These instructions should be integrated into the Orchestration Phase workflow:

1. **Pre-Validation**: Legal Validation Agent checks all documents
2. **LLM Processing**: Apply these instructions to fine-tune LLM output
3. **Human Review**: Present validated documents for human approval
4. **Final Generation**: Only proceed when all validation checks pass

This ensures that every legal document meets the highest standards of professional legal writing and is ready for court filing.
