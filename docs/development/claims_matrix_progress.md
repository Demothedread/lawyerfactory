# Claims Matrix Implementation Progress

## ✅ Phase 1.1: Enhanced Knowledge Graph Schema Extensions - COMPLETED

### Completed Tasks:

1. **✅ Extended enhanced_knowledge_graph.py with claims matrix tables**
   - Added `causes_of_action` table with jurisdiction-specific definitions
   - Added `legal_elements` table linking elements to causes of action  
   - Added `element_questions` table with provable questions for each element
   - Added `jurisdiction_authorities` table for legal authority hierarchy
   - Added `fact_element_attachments` table linking case facts to elements
   - Added comprehensive caching tables for legal research
   - Added performance indexes for all new tables

2. **✅ Created data classes for Claims Matrix components**
   - `CauseOfAction` dataclass for cause definitions
   - `LegalElement` dataclass for element breakdown
   - `ElementQuestion` dataclass for provable questions
   - `JurisdictionAuthority` dataclass for legal authorities
   - `FactElementAttachment` dataclass for fact-element linking

3. **✅ Added Claims Matrix methods to EnhancedKnowledgeGraph**
   - `add_cause_of_action()` - Store causes with jurisdiction context
   - `get_causes_of_action_by_jurisdiction()` - Retrieve jurisdiction-specific causes
   - `add_legal_element()` - Add elements to causes of action
   - `get_legal_elements_for_cause()` - Get all elements for a cause
   - `add_element_question()` - Add provable questions to elements
   - `get_element_questions()` - Retrieve element questions
   - `attach_fact_to_element()` - Link case facts to legal elements
   - `get_fact_attachments_for_element()` - Get fact attachments
   - `get_case_strength_analysis()` - Analyze case strength by cause
   - `search_entities_by_type()` - Search entities by type for analysis

## ✅ Phase 1.2: Jurisdiction Management System - COMPLETED

### Completed Tasks:

4. **✅ Created JurisdictionManager class in jurisdiction_manager.py**
   - Jurisdiction selection interface with dropdown support
   - Built jurisdiction-specific legal authority citation framework
   - Created jurisdiction switching logic with separate cached data
   - Implemented federal preemption vs state law precedence resolution
   - Added jurisdiction validation and conflict detection

5. **✅ Implemented jurisdiction configuration system**
   - Support for California state court, Federal district court, New York state court
   - Court level hierarchies and citation formats
   - Federal preemption area definitions
   - Authority precedence rankings

6. **✅ Built authority conflict resolution**
   - Federal preemption detection and resolution
   - Precedence-based authority hierarchy
   - Multi-jurisdictional authority comparison
   - Comprehensive authority management

## ✅ Phase 1.3: Cause of Action Detection Engine - COMPLETED  

### Completed Tasks:

7. **✅ Created CauseOfActionDetector class in cause_of_action_detector.py**
   - Pattern-based cause of action identification
   - Support for negligence, breach of contract, fraud, IIED, defamation
   - Confidence scoring based on supporting facts
   - Legal element breakdown for common causes
   - Element-to-provable-question mapping system

8. **✅ Built comprehensive element templates**
   - Negligence: duty, breach, causation, damages
   - Breach of contract: formation, performance, breach, damages  
   - Fraud: misrepresentation, scienter, intent, reliance, damages
   - IIED: extreme conduct, intent/recklessness, causation, distress
   - Defamation: defamatory statement, publication, falsity, damages

9. **✅ Implemented case analysis capabilities**
   - `detect_causes_from_facts()` - Analyze case facts for potential causes
   - `analyze_case_for_causes()` - Comprehensive case analysis
   - `create_cause_of_action_in_kg()` - Store detected causes in knowledge graph
   - Integration with existing knowledge graph entity extraction

## Architecture Summary

The Phase 1 core infrastructure provides:

### Database Schema
- **7 new tables** for claims matrix functionality
- **Comprehensive indexing** for performance optimization  
- **Jurisdiction-specific** cause and authority storage
- **Fact-element attachment** system for case building

### Core Classes
- **JurisdictionManager**: Handles jurisdiction selection and authority hierarchy
- **CauseOfActionDetector**: Identifies causes from facts with confidence scoring
- **Enhanced data model**: Full integration with existing knowledge graph

### Key Features  
- **Multi-jurisdiction support** with federal preemption resolution
- **Automated cause detection** from case facts with 5 common legal claims
- **Legal element breakdown** with provable questions for each element
- **Case strength analysis** based on fact-element relationships
- **Comprehensive authority management** with precedence hierarchy

## Next Phase: Legal Research Integration

Phase 2 will focus on:
- External API integration (CourtListener, Google Scholar, OpenAlex)
- Background research processing system  
- Legal research caching with performance optimization
- Real-time definition and case law retrieval

The foundation is now complete for building the interactive Claims Matrix visualization and research integration system.
